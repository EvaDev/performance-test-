# Katana configuration for performance testing
# This file increases connection limits to allow more parallel transactions

[server]
# Increase maximum concurrent connections to handle more parallel requests
max_connections = 500

# Optional: Increase request timeout for high-load scenarios
# request_timeout = 30000  # 30 seconds

# Optional: Increase keep-alive timeout
# keep_alive = 60

# Note: For maximum performance, also reduce block time when starting Katana:
# katana --dev --dev.no-fee --dev.accounts 500 --dev.seed 0 --block-time 10 --config katana.toml
# Lower block time (e.g., 10ms) allows faster block creation and higher throughput
